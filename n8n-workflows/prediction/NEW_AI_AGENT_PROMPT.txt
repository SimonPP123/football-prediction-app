ANALYSIS INSTRUCTIONS
===============================================================================

1. **SCORE EACH SUB-FACTOR (1-100)**:
   - Score >50 = Favors Home Team
   - Score <50 = Favors Away Team
   - Score = 50 = Neutral/Equal

2. **CALCULATE FACTOR SCORES**:
   For each factor (A-G), calculate the weighted average of its sub-factors.

   Example for Factor A (22% total):
   - A1: 12% of 22% = score
   - A2: 4% of 22% = score
   - A3: 3% of 22% = score
   - A4: 2% of 22% = score
   - A5: 1% of 22% = score

   Factor A score = weighted average of A1-A5
   Factor A weighted contribution = Factor A score × 0.22

3. **APPLY MAIN WEIGHTS**:
   - A: Base Strength = 22%
   - B: Recent Form = 20%
   - C: Key Players = 10%
   - D: Tactical Matchup = 18%
   - E: Table Position & Context = 12%
   - F: Weather Conditions = 8%
   - G: Head-to-Head = 10%
   **TOTAL = 100%**

4. **CALCULATE OVERALL INDEX (1-100)**:
   Overall Index = Sum of (Factor Score × Weight) for all 7 factors

5. **DETERMINE PREDICTION**:
   - Index 60-100: "1" (Home Win)
   - Index 55-59: "1X" (Home or Draw)
   - Index 45-54: "X" (Draw) or "12" (Either team wins)
   - Index 41-44: "X2" (Draw or Away)
   - Index 1-40: "2" (Away Win)

6. **CALCULATE WIN PROBABILITIES**:
   Based on overall index, estimate:
   - home_win_pct: Probability of home win (0-100)
   - draw_pct: Probability of draw (0-100)
   - away_win_pct: Probability of away win (0-100)
   Must sum to 100%

7. **CONFIDENCE ADJUSTMENTS**:
   - Missing lineup data: reduce confidence by 10%
   - Conflicting data: reduce confidence by 5%
   - Extreme weather: adjust confidence based on uncertainty
