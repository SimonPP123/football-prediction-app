HISTORICAL LEARNINGS FROM PAST ANALYSES
===============================================================================

**IMPORTANT**: Use these insights from previous match analyses to improve prediction accuracy. Look for patterns in what we got right and wrong.

**HOME TEAM ({{ $('Webhook').item.json.body.home_team }}) - Recent Analysis History:**
{{ JSON.stringify($('Webhook').item.json.body.memory_context.home_team_learnings, null, 2) }}

**AWAY TEAM ({{ $('Webhook').item.json.body.away_team }}) - Recent Analysis History:**
{{ JSON.stringify($('Webhook').item.json.body.memory_context.away_team_learnings, null, 2) }}

**How to Apply Historical Learnings:**

1. **Factor Accuracy Review**:
   - Check which factors (A-F) were accurate/inaccurate for each team in past analyses
   - If Factor C (Key Players) was consistently inaccurate for a team, investigate why
   - Adjust your confidence in factors based on their historical accuracy for each team

2. **Learning Points Application**:
   - Previous analyses identified specific lessons - apply them here
   - Example: "xG underrated for this team" -> Trust xG less for them
   - Example: "Set pieces were decisive" -> Weight Factor D aerial component higher

3. **Surprise Patterns**:
   - Teams that frequently surprise predictions may be inherently unpredictable
   - Reduce confidence when a team has many past surprises
   - Look for patterns in WHAT surprised us (goalkeeper errors, late goals, etc.)

4. **Performance vs Prediction**:
   - Compare actual past performance (xG, shots, possession) to what was predicted
   - Use this to calibrate current expectations
   - If a team consistently outperforms xG, they may have clinical finishers

5. **Track Record**:
   - Check prediction_correct field - if predictions for a team are consistently wrong, consider contrarian analysis
   - High accuracy_score teams are more predictable; low scores indicate volatility
